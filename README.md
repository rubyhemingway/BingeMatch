## Aim:
Binge Match aims to combat the growing problem of decision paralysis when scrolling streaming services to find the perfect TV Show or Movie to watch. Also, for this assignment I wanted to take on a prototype I knew would challenge me and further my learning of coding. 
## Technologies:
- Python (coding language)
- Anvil.works (coding environment)
## Features:
1. The easy to use navigation bar in a column panel on the site - allows the user to easily understand how the aim moves and works.
2. The simple search engines in the different pages of the site (different streaming services)
3. The movie/TV shows pages of the site, allowing the user to delve deeper into the recommendations the site has given them.
## Launch:
Anvil.works does not require anything additional to run the code through the site, the site runs it all for you!
## Project Status:
Prototyping stage.
## Room for Improvement:
- Getting access to an API for a streaming service. This would make the coding portion more efficient and more in-depth, allowing the site to be able to pull from many more areas of streaming platforms.
- Being able to enhance the design of the site, making it more inviting and sticking to the theme of movies and TV shows.

## Acknowledgements:
- This project was inspired by the common problem of finding myself scrolling for ages on streaming platforms trying to find something good to watch.
- This project was based on our simplei introduction to functions and conditionals, encouraging me to dive deeper and understand more about what you can do with code.
- Many thanks to Anna Savery (my tutor) for offering so much help when I was deeply struggling with understanding how to code my search bar during the start of my project. Thank you for offering to look at my code outside of class time and being understanding, as well as the time and effort put into our tutorials.
