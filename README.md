# BingeMatch
https://github.com/rubyhemingway/binge-match-1
## Aim:
Binge Match aims to combat the growing problem of decision paralysis when scrolling streaming services to find the perfect TV Show or Movie to watch. Also, for this assignment I wanted to take on a prototype I knew would challenge me and further my learning of coding. 
### Technologies:
- Python (coding language)
- Anvil.works (coding environment)
#### Launch:
Anvil.works does not require anything additional to run the code through the site, the site runs it all for you!
